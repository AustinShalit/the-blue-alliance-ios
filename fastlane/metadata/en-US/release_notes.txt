Hey yâ€™all - just a small bug fix update to hold ya over between seasons.

This update also fixes a bug where the max event year (along with some other information) wasn't updating, and a bug where going from the Team@Event view to a Team view would never fetch the Team. This update also fixes the table view header colors on iOS 13.
